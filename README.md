# Commander Scripting Console

# Scripting Console

A lightweight, GUI-based script execution platform for Windows systems.

## üîç What It Does
- Runs `.py`, `.bat`, and `.ps1` scripts silently
- GUI to write, load, and save script templates
- Logs outputs and errors for easy review

## üéØ Intended Use
For developers and learners who want:
- A clean interface for script testing and usage
- To avoid syntax errors and shell noise
- A helpful GUI without needing to open CMD or PowerShell


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: During the build process, some antivirus programs may flag the generated `.exe` as potentially malicious. This is a common false positive with Python scripts compiled using PyInstaller, especially when scripts execute system commands or spawn processes.
>
> To stay safe:
> - Always review the source code before execution.
> - Run in a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox) or sandbox environment if unsure.
> - Avoid running unknown scripts unless you trust the source.

This project contains **no malicious code**, but precautions are encouraged ‚Äî especially for beginners.
